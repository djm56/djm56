### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ WooCommerce is where I spend most of my time and the rest under the hood of WordPress.
- ğŸŒ± Node Automation, Oracle Cloud OCI, Ubuntu Lamp Stack, Docker and Redis.
- ğŸ‘¯ Currently studying system hardening and security.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about WordPress Maintenance and how I can help with WordPress.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The Blue Bulls are the best thing since sliced bread :)
